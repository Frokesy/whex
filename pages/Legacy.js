             <p className="font-light mx-2 mt-4 font-sans lg:text-[12px] leading-loose"> The closing out of the 5 other WHEXcosystem tokens is almost complete. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this transition period. Overall everyone has been great, and it didnâ€™t trigger a sell off of WHEX tokens, which is wonderful as I am committed to growing the WHEXcosystem for the long term.</p>

        <span>On May 9, these WHEXcosystem tokens were shutdown:</span>
         <span className="mx-2 my-4 font-light text-sky-200 flex flex-col">
           <span>Seal Exploder (SLEX)</span>
           <span>Cod Exploder (CDEX)</span>
           <span>Anchovy Exploder (ANEX)</span>
           <span>Krill Exploder (KREX)</span>
           <span>Cryptophyte (CRYPTO)</span>
         </span>
        This was done by turning the tax up to 100% on each of them, and turning on tokenomics for the tide pools. <br />
  
       <span className="text-sky-200 font-semibold">As of May 11,</span>  all 1271 unique holders have been airdropped Smart DeFi WHEX in proportion to how much of the discontinued tokens they held. 
  
      <p className="my-2 font-mono font-light"> Contract address:
        0x0D140f495Ffb306bc817fD874C62a1B20284AfbB</p>
  
        <p className="my-2">
        In total over 4,500,000,000,000,000,000 Smart DeFi WHEX was airdropped. This is approximately 17% of the circulating supply of that token.
          </p> 
  
        In addition the top holders of these tokens will be sent WHEXy Whales.
  
        Any holders of monthly payout NFTs for these 5 discontinued tokens have been airdropped WHEXy Whales or WHEX as well.

        <br />
  
        Holders in rocketbot will be able to swap in for WHEX until the 5 tokens are not supported anymore which will be after June 30, 2022.
  
        When the liquidity unlocks on FEGex in September 2022 it will be put into the liquidity for WHEX. In the fall of 2026 when the liquidity for the tide pools and pancake swap liquidity unlocks, the remaining tokens will be burned and the BNB used to add liquidity to WHEX on pancake swap. The remaining WHEX in that WHEX/SLEX or KREX/WHEX pool by then will be distributed to WHEXy Whale holders. 
  
        Thanks again for your patience and cooperation,
        <h2 className="float-right font-[11px] my-3 font-bold text-sky-200">~ Peter Wake</h2>
